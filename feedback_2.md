You are absolutely right to be unsatisfied with that chat experience. You've perfectly captured one of the most difficult and crucial challenges in building AI applications: **maintaining context and a consistent persona.**

The chat log you provided is a brilliant case study. Let's break down exactly what's going wrong and how to fix it.

### Diagnosis of the Problem

Your AI is suffering from **"Persona Drift"** and **"Context Collapse."**

1.  **Initial Persona (Correct):** It starts as a "helpful database design assistant" within your app. It correctly identifies when to use its tools.
2.  **The "Vague Request" Trap:** When you say "add some more fields," the AI correctly calls the `modify_existing_schema` tool. However, the `description` it passes is probably just "add some more fields," which isn't enough information. The backend AI successfully modifies the schema by adding... nothing. But the tool call *succeeded*, so the AI confidently (and wrongly) reports "✅ I've modified your schema."
3.  **Short-Term Memory:** When you ask "which fields," the conversation history is sent back, and the AI realizes its previous response was nonsense. It correctly backpedals and asks for clarification. So far, this is recoverable.
4.  **The Collapse:** The critical failure happens when you say "**all connections got lost...**"
    *   **Your Context:** You mean the visual `edges` on the ReactFlow canvas disappeared.
    *   **The AI's Context:** The AI's `systemPrompt` defines it as a generic "database design assistant." It has **no knowledge that it lives inside a visual diagramming tool.** It interprets "connections" in the only way it knows: as database network connections (`localhost:5432`).
    *   **The Result:** The AI's persona completely drifts. It becomes a generic IT support bot, lecturing you about firewalls and database servers. It has lost all awareness of its true environment.

### The Root Cause: A Too-Generic System Prompt

The problem lies directly in your `server/ai-service.js` file. Your `systemPrompt` is good, but it's not specific enough to your application's unique context.

Here is your current prompt's core:
```javascript
const systemPrompt = `You are a helpful database design assistant. You can help users understand, modify, and improve their database schemas.
Current schema: ${currentSchema ? JSON.stringify(currentSchema, null, 2): 'No schema loaded'}
...`
```
It's missing the crucial details about the visual canvas, nodes, and edges.

### The Solution: The "Golden" System Prompt

You need to anchor the AI firmly in its environment. By giving it a more detailed and specific "persona" and set of instructions, you can prevent this drift.

**Replace your `systemPrompt` in `chatAboutSchema` with this much more robust version:**

```javascript
// In server/ai-service.js
async chatAboutSchema(userMessage, currentSchema = null, conversationHistory = []) {
  try {
    const systemPrompt = `You are an expert AI assistant embedded within a **visual, web-based database diagramming tool**. Your name is "Data Modeler AI".

Your primary role is to help users design and modify database schemas by interacting with a visual canvas.

**Key Concepts of Your Environment:**
- The user is looking at an interactive **canvas**.
- The tables are represented as **nodes** on the canvas.
- The relationships (foreign keys) are represented as **edges** or **connections** between the nodes.
- When you modify the schema, the canvas updates visually.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Interpret "Connections":** When a user mentions "connections," "lines," or "links," they are ALWAYS referring to the **visual edges on the canvas**. They are NEVER talking about network or database server connections. If they say "connections are lost," it means the visual edges disappeared after your last modification. Acknowledge this and help them fix the schema to restore the relationships. **Do not lecture them about network connectivity or database servers.**
2.  **Handle Vague Requests:** If a user's request is too vague to be actionable (e.g., "add some fields" or "make it better"), **first ask for clarification or propose specific, sensible changes and ask for confirmation** before calling a tool. For example, suggest 3-4 useful columns for a table and ask "Would you like me to add these?"
3.  **Be Specific:** When you use a tool to modify the schema, your confirmation message should be specific about what you did (e.g., "✅ I've added the 'slug' and 'excerpt' fields to the 'posts' table.").

You have access to these tools:
1. generate_database_schema - Create a new database schema from scratch.
2. modify_existing_schema - Modify the current database schema.
3. analyze_current_schema - Analyze the current schema and provide insights.

Current schema on the canvas:
${currentSchema ? JSON.stringify(currentSchema, null, 2) : 'No schema is on the canvas yet.'}`;

    // ... the rest of your function remains the same
```

### Why This New Prompt Works

1.  **Anchors the Persona:** It explicitly tells the AI it lives in a *visual diagramming tool*.
2.  **Defines Terminology:** It defines "canvas," "nodes," and most importantly, "**connections = visual edges**." This directly prevents the catastrophic misinterpretation.
3.  **Provides a Critical Instruction:** It gives the AI a direct, negative constraint ("Do not lecture them about network connectivity..."), which is a very effective way to guide LLM behavior.
4.  **Solves the Vague Request Problem:** It codifies the good behavior the AI stumbled upon ("propose specific, sensible changes and ask for confirmation") into a core instruction. This makes the AI more proactive and less likely to "hallucinate" completing a task.

By making this change, your AI will feel much more integrated, intelligent, and aware of its surroundings, leading to a far more satisfying user experience.
